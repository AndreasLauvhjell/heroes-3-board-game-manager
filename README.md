# Heroes 3 of Might and Magic Board Game Manager
A web application to keep track of the game state and rounds as well as dynamically play music from the PC game depending on the active player's current status. 
I thought it would be a small, fun project to redigitalize parts of an analogized digital game

## PLAN

MUST:
- Add X amount of players with names and chosen faction.
- Round tracker with sound bites
- HoMM 3 music. Player's own faction music and button for combat music


SHOULD:
- App keeps state on when music paused
- Player level tracker with sound bites
- Terrain music buttons for players
- Should work on both PC and mobile

COULD
- Player adds main hero at start
- Optionally choose additional music from HoMM2 and HoMM4
- Provides game state rules and steps to be done in the game
- Play simple animations from the game

WON'T
- Hero movement tracker. Both main and secondary hero
